# **Accumulators**

Accumulators subscribe to streams of specific event types and the [router](../newrelic/router.go) forwards matching Loggregator envelopes to the accumulators for processing. 

## **Event Types**

All metrics include the PCF meta data. Only PCFContainerMetric and PCFLogMessage hold application specific data. All other metrics pertain to PCF System metrics.
